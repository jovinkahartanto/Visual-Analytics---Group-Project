# Introduction 
The VAST 2021 Mini Challenge 2 outlines a hypothetical scenario in which several GAStech employees have gone missing and the organisation, Protectors of Kronos (POK), is suspected of being involved. The dataset includes two weeks of GPS tracking data for company cars assigned to employees, credit and loyalty card transactions of employees before the disappearance. ESRI shapefiles for the city of Abila & country Kronos are also provided. The challenge requires identification of suspicious activities hidden in data and determine any dubious people and locations that should be reported to the police.

The dataset is wrangled to develop a Shiny app that aims to provide users actionable insights based on the following analyses:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of GPS tracking data and credit and loyalty card transaction patterns
* Visualisation of employee movements over time and associated purchase transactions
* Network analysis of employees based on their visited locations
