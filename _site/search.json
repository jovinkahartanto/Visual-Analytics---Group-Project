      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2021 IEEE VAST Challenge brings back a classic challenge to see how approaches and techniques have developed since its original release. This year’s challenge will be a variation on a previous year’s challenge, with modified data and new questions. The following information is extracted from the Vast Challenge site.\r\nOverview\r\nNote: This scenario and all the people, places, groups, technologies, contained therein are fictitious. Any resemblance to real people, places, groups, or technologies is purely coincidental.\r\nIn the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.\r\nIn January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.\r\nAs an expert in visual analytics, our group, Group 5, is called in to help law enforcement from Kronos and Tethys.\r\nMini-Challenge 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the Abila, Kronos-based employees of GAStech have company cars which are approved for both personal and business use. Those who do not have company cars have the ability to check out company trucks for business use, but these trucks cannot be used for personal business.\r\nEmployees with company cars are happy to have these vehicles, because the company cars are generally much higher quality than the cars they would be able to afford otherwise. However, GAStech does not trust their employees. Without the employees? knowledge, GAStech has installed geospatial tracking software in the company vehicles. The vehicles are tracked periodically as long as they are moving.\r\nThis vehicle tracking data has been made available to law enforcement to support their investigation. Unfortunately, data is not available for the day the GAStech employees went missing. Data is only available for the two weeks prior to the disappearance.\r\nTo promote local businesses, Kronos based companies provide a Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards. This data has been made available to investigators in the hopes that it can help resolve the situation. However, Kronos Kares does not collect personal information beyond purchases.\r\nAs a visual analytics expert assisting law enforcement, your mission is to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. You must cope with uncertainties that result from missing, conflicting, and imperfect data to make recommendations for further investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Overview\r\nIn the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.\r\nIn January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.\r\n2. Objectives\r\nBoth historical vehicle tracking data and transaction data from loyalty and credit card will be used to observe the following issues:\r\nThe most popular locations and when they are popular\r\nInfer the owner of each credit card and loyalty card\r\nIdentify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel\r\nAnalyze unusual and suspicious activities of the employees\r\nAnalyze daily routines of GasTech employees\r\n3. Previous Work and GIS Application\r\nGeographic information system (GIS) data has been used by different business and entities for many purposes. Police agencies are using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for mapping crime, identifying crime “hot spots,” assigning officers, and profiling offenders.\r\nAccording to a 2001 survey by the National Institute of Justice, 62 percent of police departments with over 100 officers use GIS systems. Collectively, the technology has been credited with reducing crime, decreasing residential burglaries, tracking parolees and serious habitual offenders, and identifying “hot spots” with high concentrations of crime.\r\nIs the Use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for Policing Effective?, 2014\r\n4. Data Sources\r\nThe data source are available publicly on VAST Challenge 2021 website under the sub section Mini-Challenge 2. The data used for the project are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeospatial maps of Abila and Kronos Island\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Map of Abila, Kronos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54 employees details of GAStech\r\n\r\nLastName\r\nFirstName\r\nBirthDate\r\nBirthCountry\r\nGender\r\nBramar\r\nMat\r\n1981-12-19\r\nTethys\r\nMale\r\nRibera\r\nAnda\r\n1975-11-17\r\nTethys\r\nFemale\r\nPantanal\r\nRachel\r\n1984-08-22\r\nTethys\r\nFemale\r\nLagos\r\nLinda\r\n1980-01-26\r\nTethys\r\nFemale\r\nMies Haber\r\nRuscella\r\n1964-04-26\r\nKronos\r\nFemale\r\nForluniau\r\nCarla\r\n1981-06-02\r\nKronos\r\nFemale\r\n\r\n44 employees car assignments\r\n\r\nLastName\r\nFirstName\r\nCarID\r\nCurrentEmploymentType\r\nCurrentEmploymentTitle\r\nCalixto\r\nNils\r\n1\r\nInformation Technology\r\nIT Helpdesk\r\nAzada\r\nLars\r\n2\r\nEngineering\r\nEngineer\r\nBalas\r\nFelix\r\n3\r\nEngineering\r\nEngineer\r\nBarranco\r\nIngrid\r\n4\r\nExecutive\r\nSVP/CFO\r\nBaza\r\nIsak\r\n5\r\nInformation Technology\r\nIT Technician\r\nBergen\r\nLinnea\r\n6\r\nInformation Technology\r\nIT Group Manager\r\n\r\n1,490 credit card transactions for 55 unique credit card numbers\r\n\r\ntimestamp\r\nlocation\r\nprice\r\nlast4ccnum\r\n01/06/2014 07:28\r\nBrew’ve Been Served\r\n11.34\r\n4795\r\n01/06/2014 07:34\r\nHallowed Grounds\r\n52.22\r\n7108\r\n01/06/2014 07:35\r\nBrew’ve Been Served\r\n8.33\r\n6816\r\n01/06/2014 07:36\r\nHallowed Grounds\r\n16.72\r\n9617\r\n01/06/2014 07:37\r\nBrew’ve Been Served\r\n4.24\r\n7384\r\n01/06/2014 07:38\r\nBrew’ve Been Served\r\n4.17\r\n5368\r\n\r\n685,168 GPS log data from 6 Jan 2014 to 19 Jan 2014\r\n\r\nTimestamp\r\nid\r\nlat\r\nlong\r\n01/06/2014 06:28:01\r\n35\r\n36.07623\r\n24.87469\r\n01/06/2014 06:28:01\r\n35\r\n36.07622\r\n24.87460\r\n01/06/2014 06:28:03\r\n35\r\n36.07621\r\n24.87444\r\n01/06/2014 06:28:05\r\n35\r\n36.07622\r\n24.87425\r\n01/06/2014 06:28:06\r\n35\r\n36.07621\r\n24.87417\r\n01/06/2014 06:28:07\r\n35\r\n36.07619\r\n24.87406\r\n\r\n1,392 loyalty card transactions for 54 unique loyalty card numbers\r\n\r\ntimestamp\r\nlocation\r\nprice\r\nloyaltynum\r\n01/06/2014\r\nBrew’ve Been Served\r\n4.17\r\nL2247\r\n01/06/2014\r\nBrew’ve Been Served\r\n9.60\r\nL9406\r\n01/06/2014\r\nHallowed Grounds\r\n16.53\r\nL8328\r\n01/06/2014\r\nCoffee Shack\r\n11.51\r\nL6417\r\n01/06/2014\r\nHallowed Grounds\r\n12.93\r\nL1107\r\n01/06/2014\r\nBrew’ve Been Served\r\n4.27\r\nL4034\r\n\r\n5. Methodology and Analytical Approach\r\nOur group aims to provide users with an interactive to derive insights from the data source. RStudio is the main software tool that will be used for analysing and developing the project artefact and output. R packages, such as dplyr, reshape2, tidyr, lubridate and tmap will be used to perform data manipulation, data transformation and geospatial plots of map. In addition, GGplot2 and Shiny will be used to create visualisations for the app.\r\nThe analytical approach of this study are as follow:\r\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): to understand the patterns and the relationship between the GPS, car assignment, and transaction data. EDA will also performed to detect any missing data, outliers, and or anomalies that might exist in the dataset\r\nExploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA): to visualize and explore island map and GPS route and to determine the popularity for each location\r\nCredit card and loyalty card mapping: to identify card ownership\r\nNetwork analysis: to visualize and identify unusual relationship among employees and locations\r\nR Markdown and R Shiny to prepare the report and user interface\r\nThe time frame for this project is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Project Gantt Chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Assumptions\r\nThe main underlying assumption lies with the mapping of location details on the credit cards and loyalty cards data to the travel route of each vehicle. The data does not provide the GPS location in the credit and loyalty cards transaction data. Hence apart from assigning the various locations in the cards data with a GPS coordinate, a sorting of time stamps is also required to determine when the vehicles had become stationary. Where the vehicles stopped at is assumed to be where the employees have gone at that specific time period.\r\n7. Application Design\r\nData Visualisation\r\nHeat map to identify popular locations at various time periods\r\nVisualize movement and temporal changes of the GPS tracking data on Abila geospatial map\r\nBoxplot for transaction data from credit card and loyalty card\r\nNetwork analysis to show potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel and locations of visit\r\nApplication Interface\r\nThe Shiny App is envisioned to have these functionalities:\r\nMultiple values (drop down) of employees to display moving line from GPS data on Abila map, filtered by day and time period\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Dashboard Interface 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeat map and box plot filtered by location, day and time period\r\nInterative charts with tooltips\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Dashboard Interface 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMapping of credit card and loyalty card to employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Dashboard Interface 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteractive network analysis filtered by employee, location and department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Dashboard Interface 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
