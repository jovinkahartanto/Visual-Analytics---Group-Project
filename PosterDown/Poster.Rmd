# Introduction

The VAST 2021 Mini Challenge 2 outlines a hypothetical scenario in which several GAStech employees have gone missing and the organisation, Protectors of Kronos (POK), is suspected of being involved. The challenge requires identification of suspicious activities hidden in data and determine any dubious people and locations that should be reported to the law enforcement using interactive visual analytical tools.

# Movtivation and objectives

Our research and development effort aims to enable Kronos law enforcement with the ability to easily analyse, drill down and identify key suspects and suspicious locations, and thereby speeding up the investigation process. 

The use cases of the data visualisation tool include but are not limited to the following:

* The most popular locations and when they are popular
* Infer the owner of each credit card and loyalty card
* Identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel
* Analyze unusual and suspicious activities of the employees 
* Analyze daily routines of GasTech employees

The application hat aims to provide users actionable insights based on the following analyses:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of GPS tracking data and credit and loyalty card transaction patterns
* Visualisation of employee movements over time and associated purchase transactions
* Network analysis of employees based on their visited locations

# Approach and Methodology

# Application

The Application was designed using R Shiny and hosted on shinyapps.io server. The application has 5 main section with various interactive visual analytics tools to allow users to investigate the data. The user guide to the application is available at [https://isss608g1group5.netlify.app/userguide.html](https://isss608g1group5.netlify.app/userguide.html).

## Abila Kronos Map

Add desc and picture here later!!!

## Locations Transactions

```{r heatmap, fig.cap='Heatmap'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/heatmap-shiny.png")
```

```{r boxplot, fig.cap='Boxplot'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/boxplot-shiny.png")
```

```{r barplot, fig.cap='Barplot'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/barplot-shiny.png")
```

## Card Mapping

```{r parcoord, fig.cap='Parallel Coordinate Plot'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/parcoord-shiny.png")
```

## Network Analysis

```{r network1, fig.cap='Network Analysis based on Credit Card Transactions'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/network-cc-shiny.png")
```

```{r network2, fig.cap='Network Analysis based on GPS data'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/network-gps-shiny.png")
```

# Future Work

# Conclusion

Through the utilisation of interactive visual analytical tools in the Shiny application, users can visualise patterns and anomaly activities of the employees. The user-friendly layout incorporated with drop down filters allow users to slice the data and utilise the interactivity of each visusalisation to investigate the data without knowledge of programming or data analytics.

<!-- This is the `posterdown_betterport` template for the {posterdown} package! I was inspired by the twitter thread of [Mike Morrison](https://mobile.twitter.com/mikemorrison/status/1110191245035479041) and wanted to apply the `#betterposter` concept to the reproducible (yet simple to use) functionality of the {posterdown} package [@R-posterdown]. If you're not an R user don't sweat as you do **NOT** need to use it at all! Feel free to use only the Markdown functionality of this package :) -->

<!-- ```{r, include=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::write_bib(c('posterdown', 'rmarkdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib') -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Objectives -->

<!-- 1. Pick a template layout. -->
<!-- 2. Write/ create your poster content distraction free. -->
<!-- 3. Let posterdown do its thing! -->

<!-- # Methods -->

<!-- I will show here how to include poster elements that may be useful, such as an equation using mathjax: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E = mc^2 -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- To reference a citation you can add your `.bib` file to the working directory and name it in the YAML metadata or generate an automated one as done here, then you only need to reference the label value in the `.bib` file. For example this package is built on top of the wonderful {pagedown} package and I will cite it at the end of this sentance using this in the rmd `[@R-pagedown]` [@R-pagedown]. -->

<!-- To get a better understanding of how to include features like these please refer to the {posterdown} [wiki](https://github.com/posterdown/wiki). -->

<!-- **_Now on to the results!_** -->

<!-- # Results -->

<!-- Here you may have some figures to show off, bellow I have made a scatterplot with the infamous Iris dataset and I can even reference to the figure automatically like this, `Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure)`, Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure). -->

<!-- ```{r, irisfigure, fig.cap='Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the "fig.cap" option in the r code chunk options, see this [link](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) from the legend himself, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui).', out.width="80%"} -->
<!-- par(mar=c(2,2,0,1)) -->
<!-- plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width, -->
<!--      col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Sepal Length", -->
<!--      ylab = "Sepal Width") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Maybe you want to show off some of that fancy code you spent so much time on to make that figure, well you can do that too! Just use the `echo=TRUE` option in the r code chunk options, Figure \@ref(fig:myprettycode)! -->

<!-- ```{r myprettycode, echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Boxplots, so hot right now!', fig.height=6, out.width="80%"} -->
<!-- #trim whitespace -->
<!-- par(mar=c(2,2,0,0)) -->
<!-- #plot boxplots -->
<!-- boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species, -->
<!--         col = "#008080", -->
<!--         border = "#0b4545", -->
<!--         ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)", -->
<!--         xlab = "Species") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable): -->

<!-- ```{r, iristable} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   iris[1:15,1:5], format = "html", -->
<!--   caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.", -->
<!--   align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length", -->
<!--                              "Sepal <br> Width", -->
<!--                              "Petal <br> Length", -->
<!--                              "Petal <br> Width", -->
<!--                              "Species"), -->
<!--   escape = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
