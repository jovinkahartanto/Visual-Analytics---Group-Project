# 1. Overview
In the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.

In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.

# 2. Objectives
Both historical vehicle tracking data and transaction data from loyalty and credit card will be used to observe the following issues:

1. The most popular locations and when they are popular
2. Infer the owner of each credit card and loyalty card
3. Identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel
4. Analyze suspicious activity of the missing personnel prior to the disappearance


# 3. Past Related Work

# 4. Data Sources

# 5. Methodology and Analytical Approach
The approaches of this study are as follow:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA will be performed on GPS, car assignment, loyalty and credit card transaction data to understand the patterns and correlation between the data. EDA will also performed to detect any missing data, outliers, and  or anomalies that might exist in the dataset. 

2. Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA): 



# 6. Application Design

## Data Visualisation
* Heat maps to identify popular location prior to the disappearance

## Application Interface 
The Shiny App is envisioned to have these functionalities:

* Allow users to input the top n number of popular and suspicious location.
