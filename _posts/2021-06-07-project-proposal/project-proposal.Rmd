# 1. Overview
In the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.

In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.

# 2. Objectives
Both historical vehicle tracking data and transaction data from loyalty and credit card will be used to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior.

# 3. Past Related Work

# 4. Methodology and Analytical Approach

# 5. Application Design

## Data Visualisation
* Heat maps to identify popular location prior to the disappearance

## Application Interface 
* Allow users to input the top n number of popular and suspicious location.
